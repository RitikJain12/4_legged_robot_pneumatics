This repository is the documentation of 4 legged robot using pneumatics along with LQR implementation in the robocon competition 2018-19.

# 4 legged robot pneumatics
4 legged quadrapuled robot, based on the stm32f407 micro-controller(ARM based controller), which uses a LQR control architecture. LQR controller is implemented to control pnuematic touch down, height during flight and forward velocity. Also we have use IMU sensor for pitch and roll control. We have used a camera for autonomous locomotion.
